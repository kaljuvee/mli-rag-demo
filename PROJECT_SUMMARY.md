- **FAISS vector store** for embedding-based search
- **Pandas DataFrames** for data manipulation
- **Excel file processing** with openpyxl

### AI/ML Layer
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** for natural language processing
- **OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002** for vector embeddings
- **LangChain framework** for AI workflow orchestration
- **Scikit-learn** for additional ML utilities

### Application Layer

- **FastAPI** for API services
- **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM
- **Python-dotenv** for environment management

## Data Analysis Capabilities

### Portfolio Insights
The application can analyze **1,250 existing properties** and **5 marketed warehouses** across multiple dimensions:

- **Physical characteristics**: Size, eaves height, doors, parking spaces
- **Geospatial attributes**: Latitude, longitude, regional distribution
- **Temporal factors**: Build year, age analysis
- **Performance metrics**: EPC ratings, energy efficiency

### Query Examples
The system successfully handles complex queries such as:

1. **"Find the 10 most similar properties in the estate to the newly marketed property"**
   - Uses vector similarity search across multiple property attributes
   - Returns ranked results based on comprehensive feature matching

2. **"Provide a correlation score for the homogeneity of the marketed property(ies) with the rest of the estate"**
   - Analyzes physical characteristics, location, and age separately
   - Generates quantitative similarity metrics

3. **"Find the closest properties to the marketed property, after excluding any property in the portfolio that is more than 10 miles from a major city"**
   - Combines geospatial filtering with similarity analysis
   - Demonstrates complex multi-criteria decision making

## Implementation Quality

### Code Organization
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Utility packages** for reusable components
- **Comprehensive testing** with unit tests
- **Documentation** and inline comments

### Best Practices
